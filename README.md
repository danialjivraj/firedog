# firedog
Firedog is a 2D game built from scratch with over 19k lines of code and over 648 different assets (499 images and 149 audio files).

This game was created by using HTML Canvas and pure Javascript without relying on external frameworks except for 
Electron, which was utilized to transform it into a Desktop application.

## Story and Objective
Embark on a thrilling quest as Firedog to recover the stolen Cryptic Token, pilfered by an enigmatic thief! <br>

This is a story-based game which includes 6 different maps, with over 48 different enemies and a final boss. <br>
Your objective on each map is to eliminate as many enemies as you can, gathering sufficient coins to advance to the next stage of your journey! <br>

Your progress will be automatically saved whenever you complete a map or adjust your settings (such as audio, skin selection, or level difficulty).
