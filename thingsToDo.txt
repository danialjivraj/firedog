    fix map name styling when the name of map is in 2 different lines - ignore it for now

bug: enemy lore seems to cause the gameplay to be slow somehow? - 
     leaving key pressed as Tab is pressed in cutscene gets that key stuck -

make the story shorter - beginning a lot to take in 
Leave it as it is:
    Add a ROLLING cooldown, maybe use the diving cooldown. Leave it as it is.
    make dive waste energy? probably not a good idea, leave it as it is now.
    idea: when in blue mode, if player dives, make fireballs spread out around player.
    maybe make enemies spawn things when they die? is this powerups maybe or extra coins?
    IDEA : sky fight dragon ball style
    Zabkous enemy player collision feels weird and buggy. needs fixing?
    have a look to make blood indicator to be drawn direcly instead of using a fixed sized image - no need for this anymore

    improvements that could be made but not necessary:
    make cutscenes extendable to make it easier to manage
    make damage indicator use the draw() instead of pushing an image
        which connects on map 3 with the ticking sound
    make audio and ingame audio extendable
    make entityAnimation in backgroundfile more readeable
    make tests
    player stood up when he died, rare bug but look into it.
    add levels of difficulty. easy, medimum, hard - make enemies spawn more the harder the level- half done - finish this at the end.
    after all audios are in game, try to find a way to make the audios the same decibels at same percentage
    small bug - when hit by electricwheel and barrier at the same time and falling
            on elyvorg, barrier looses 2 health bars while firedog gets hit once from it.
    during cutscene when coming out of pause by using leftClick/Enter it also triggers the cutscene text -

Elyvorg appears and takes them. Firedog asks what elyvorg is doing, and then he reveals his true intention, that he used Firedog to 
defeat Dusker, so he could take the cryptic tokens for himself. he begins to puzzle the cryptic tokens in the wrong order, which Firedog
